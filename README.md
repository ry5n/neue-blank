# Neue Blank

A completely zero-width font with a very basic character set. Designed specifically for working around the inability to remove whitespace between inline-block elements in Android 2.3 through 4.2, hence only TrueType font files are included out of the box.

Inspired by [Adobe Blank](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/adobe-blank) and others, independently implemented.

## Installation

Download one of the [releases](https://github.com/ry5n/neue-blank/releases), or install with bower:

```bash
bower install --save ry5n/neue-blank
```

## Usage

The distribution contains the webfont as a data-uri in both css and scss flavours; `@import` at will, or include the font file separately if you really need to.
